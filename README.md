## 🧭 Git & Branching Guidelines

To keep our project clean and avoid merge conflicts, please follow these Git rules when contributing.

---

### 🌳 Branch Structure

We use three main types of branches:

| Branch | Purpose | Who works on it |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| `main` | Stable, production-ready code | Protected – only merged via PRs |
| `dev` | Integration branch for testing features | All developers |
| `feature/*` | For individual tasks or features | Each teammate |


---

### Workflow

Pull latest changes:
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

Create your own feature branch:
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Work on your feature (edit files, test locally, commit often).

Stage and commit your changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you did here"

Sync before pushing (optional but recommended):
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev

Push your branch:
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

Create a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch into dev and request a review before merging.

---

### Rules

- Do not commit directly to main or dev  
- Always create a feature branch for your work  
- Make small, clear commits  
- Always pull latest changes before starting work  
- Merge into dev only through pull requests
