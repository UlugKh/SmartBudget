# App shell is the widget that manages the logic behind navigation and main was decided to be kept clean for readability purposes
## util - utility classes
## providers - connection between sqlite db to frontend (provides a way)
## pages - each page is its own file (reports is used as a Widget in Monitoring, hence the extra file)
