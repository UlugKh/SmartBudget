## Meeting Purpose
We decided to formally begin working on the mobile project with increased commitment and organization. This meeting served as an official kickoff to reinforce team structure and establish clear development workflows.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Role Clarification
- Reviewed and confirmed each team member's roles and responsibilities as outlined in the project README
- Ensured everyone understands their specific contributions to the project

### 2. GitHub Structure & Workflow
- Explained the current GitHub repository structure in detail
- Emphasized the importance of following branch protection rules
- Outlined the proper workflow for working with branches

### 3. Critical Development Guidelines

#### Main File Conflict Prevention
- **STRICT RULE:** Do not commit changes to `main.dart`
- All team members must work exclusively within their respective `page.dart` files
- This prevents merge conflicts in the main application file

#### Backend Integration
- Backend team members will handle all routing and integration of individual pages
- Frontend developers focus solely on their assigned page components

## Communication Protocol

### Issue Resolution
- Problems should be communicated immediately through:
  - Additional organized meetings if necessary
  - Telegram group for quick discussions
  - In-person discussions at university

### Documentation Standards
- **Only formal meetings will be documented**
- Informal conversations (Telegram, casual discussions) will not be recorded in official documentation
- This meeting serves as the official project commencement record

## Next Steps
- All team members begin active development on their assigned pages
